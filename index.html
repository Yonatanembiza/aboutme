        <h2>Fun fact about my neighbors</h2>
        <p> My neighbor is a cat named Mr. Whiskers, he has been living in the house for 5 years now.
            He loves to sleep on the windowsill and eat food that I leave out for him.
            One day when I was trying to clean up his litter box, he started growling at me.
            So I decided to let him stay.
